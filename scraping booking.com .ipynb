      "Breakfast is hectic- so many people and not enough tables the quality is just ok. Its a nonsmoking hotel and they ask you to sign a waiver, but guest still smoked cigarettes. Always seemed to have swimming lessons going on in the pool when we stayed and they took up the entire pool. Karaoke from the conference room can be heard in the rooms and seems to go on all night. The rooms are old and seem to be falling apart.\n",
      "It is near a masjid and very frequently they shout in the mike that too in the early morning with a worst voice. If i would have know this is near masjid i should have avoided booking this hotel. I learned it now when ever i book my hotel i make sure i check this first.\n",
      "Breakfast was very limited choice for vegetarians and we did not enjoyed the breakfast at all. We never had lunch and dinner in this hotel\n",
      "Otherwise it was all good.\n",
      "Noisy, small room, faulty air conditioning\n",
      "Room 327 has a few external air conditioner units behind the wall, so it makes an uncomfortable noise during the night. I asked for help and staff promptly moved us to a new quiet room.\n",
      "Bathroom was smelling and the sink was clogged. The fruit of the breakfast had a strange taste probably because there was a leaf where it was lying on. Sky lounge was not a lounge but an attic.\n",
      "I like the staff's service standard, good !\n",
      "1. I had requested an early check in which had been acknowledged by the hotel. However, the room was not ready and it took a while\n",
      "2. While waiting for the room, decided to have lunch in their restaurant which was kind of a let down. We had ordered a simple lunch of rice, Chicken chap cai and gado gado. The chap chai was absolutely bland (surprising for an indonesian cuisine) and did not come with any chilli / condiment. Further, the gado gado was brought when we had almost finished our meal. Restaurant was hot and they turned on the HVAC only after a few reminders. I would not recommend a meal in this restaurant apart from teh breakfast - which was perhaps the only highlight\n",

      "abit far from the usual attractions\n",
      "Maybe because it's during peak season so the rate was high and not comparable to the facilities that they offered. The room is pretty basic and not spacious enough for two people. As my room was located in the first floor and near the lobby, it's not the quietest place to rest. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dining room was rather small compared, so it wasn't easy to find a space during breakfast time.\n",
      "Distance from shopping centres and tourist attractions . Good English-speaking but stiff Front Desk staff members who confined roles to matters related to room allocation. (F&B team was cheerful . Housekeeping team was helpful).\n",
      "room cleanliness it’s very bad, I found a lot of hair in bathroom, tea cups look doesn’t wash, bedsheets a lot of stain\n",
      "There are very few western food options, specially for breakfast.\n",
      "TV channels are not good and clear.  Some old furnitures need to be replaced or renovated\n",
      "very dirty room. dirty sheets, dirty floor, very outdated. changes room after the first night. Was an improvement but still not clean.\n",
      "The staff in reception not really friendly. No smile and seems not ok with further questions. We're being placed in 1st floor. Usually staff will ask like if we're ok put in a lower level building.\n",
      "Also the room in 103 were not really ok, the tap were broken, the flash in toilet also broken.\n",
      "The balcony view was on the ground floor facing the pool - there wasn't any privacy at all\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a shame that we couldn't sit by the pool or outside for breakfast as this was the smoking area.\n"

      "Schlechtes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Zu teuer, für zu wenig gute Leistung. Das Zimmer ist sehr hellhörig. Das Frühstück ist absolut mangelhaft. Da erwarten wir mehr bei solch einem Hotel.

      "De shuttle naar het vliegveld was een normale auto. Wij hebben vooraf aangegeven dat we met 4 personen en 4 koffers waren. 1 persoon zat vervolgens tussen de koffers en moest zichzelf daartussen wurmen. De handbagage tassen moesten we op schoot zetten omdat ook daar geen ruimte voor was.\n",
      "没有电梯，热水不够用，两个人洗澡，第二个人洗的时候就只有温水了\n",
      "Отель уже морально устарел, 4 звёзд не осталось, это видно во всем - грязные стены, серые полотенца, сломанная сантехника, кондиционер в коридоре у лифта не работал. На второй день появился сильных запах канализации в ванной комнате, попросили устранить, помогло буквально до вечера, потом опять появился. Ещё нужно иметь в виду, что на 4 этаже очень слышно звуки нескольких мечетей, которые начинаются в 5 утра.\n",

      "Die Zimmeraustattung ist alt\n",
      "De kamer. Allereerst was de kamer een kamer met twee uit elkaar staande bedden die alleen ver van de muur af aan elkaar konden worden geschoven en makkelijk uit elkaar schoven waardoor je ertussen viel. Daarnaast was de airco defect waardoor er ijs en water uitkwam als je hem aanzette. Tot slot was de kluis kapot, al werd die redelijk snel gemaakt.\n",

      "Un dia se’ns va trencar un got (que evidentment vam pagar) i ja no ens el van reposar. \n",
      "Els serveis de shuttle eren cars.\n",
      "El desayuno está muy orientado al cliente asiático, pero para el europeo poca variedad de pan, cereales, mermeladas … (la mantequilla está en un vaso común y te sirves a cucharadas)\n",
      "Kamer was helemaal achterin de hotel zonder uitzicht op het zwembad en naast een generator. Hierdoor kunnen wij niet op ons balkon zitten vanwege het geluid. Alle maintenance personeel liep er langs door een deur naast onze kamer. Het geluid van het moskee was niet eens zo vervelend.\n",
      "Salle de bain pourrait être mieux entretenue. Manque de transat pour le nombre de chambre. Et massage pas terrible.\n",
      "- kamers verouderd\n",
      "De staat van het hotel is enorm verouderd. Het voelde vies aan. Denk aan gaten in de douche (in de badkuip) en gele douchegordijnen. We hadden gevraagd om een kamer met 1 tweepersoonsbed en kregen 2 eenpersoonsbedden. Na een upgrade kregen we de junior suite (we hebben deze zelf betaald zodat we 1 bed kregen) die vies aanvoelde. Er zat een hagedis in de kamer en allemaal kleine beestjes. Ook werden we om 4 uur gewekt door de moskee. We zijn eerder uitgecheckt om naar een ander hotel te gaan dat wel fijn was.\n"

Por ejemplo el papel de las paredes estaba levantado, la silicona/juntas de los baños negras de la humedad y el tiempo, el lavabo tenía un desagüe incómodo ya que para que tragase había que meter la mano y levantarlo cada vez que lo usabas, etc. Son cosas que no tienen gran importancia teniendo en cuenta relación calidad/precio pero pienso que podrían estar mejor de cara a ser un 10 o a dar mejor impresión.\n",

      "Leider ist das Hotel ziemlich in die Jahre gekommen. Wir mussten einmal das Zimmer wechseln, Grund war die Klimaanlage, die die Nacht durchtropfte. Der Safe war defekt. Im Waschbecken lief das Wasser nicht ab, der Wasserhahn blieb zudem nicht an und musste während des Waschens immer mit einer Hand gehalten werden. Der Fön überhitzte nach circa 30 Sekunden und fiel aus.

WC die niet goed flush, airconditioning hebben we moeten laten schoonmaken door het personeel want ons kind krijgt een hoestaanval elke keer dat de airco aanstond. De kamer zijn niet goed geïsoleerd waardoor je alles hoort wat op de gang gebeurd.

Finalmente entraron por el balcón (segunda planta, entrando por otros balcones de habitaciones ocupadas), a pesar de que expresamos nuestra negación para entrar por el balcón y por nuestra habitación.
